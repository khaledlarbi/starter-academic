## Pratical classes about simple exploratory data analysis in SAS

## Lecture about SAS software

## Lecture about EDA (French)

Here you would find a lecture about exploratory data analysis. After some reminders about simple exploratory data analysis, I introduced PCA, CA and MCA. You would also find tutorials and pratical classes (I will add the answers latter).
